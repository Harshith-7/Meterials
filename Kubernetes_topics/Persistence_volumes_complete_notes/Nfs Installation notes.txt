Nfs-server Installation
 first update your system
    apt update
step:-1
 Installation:
      sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server
step:-2

First of all, we will create a directory named “/mnt/share” that is going to be shared by all client systems
    sudo mkdir -p /mnt/share
step:-3(Set directory permissions0
 Next, set the permissions of the created “/mnt/share” directory so that all client machines can easily access it
  sudo chown -R nobody:nogroup /mnt/share/

Step:-4  (Set file Permissions)
  Set the file permissions as required. In our case, we have allocated the read, write, and execute permissions to the “/mnt/share” directory files
  sudo chmod 777 /mnt/share/

Step:-5 (grant NFS access)
    In this step, we will grant access to the client system for accessing the NFS server. To do so  open "/etc/exports" in the vi editor

   sudo vi /etc/exports
   /mnt/share IP(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)


Step:-6 (Exporting NFS directory)
    Utiliz the provided command for exporting the NFS shared directory
     sudo  exportfs -a
 
Step:-7 (Restart NFS server)  
   Write out the provided command for restarting the NFS server 
   sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
